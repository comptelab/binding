## Across-area synchronization supports feature integration in working memory

Only networks with load 2 where connected, but we also provided unconnected networks with load 2.

To run N simulations in paralell use "python run_models.py N". This will generate .model files than can be analyzed/plot later. To plot, use plot_bump.py.

Aditionally, there is also some code use for analyses. PPI code was developed by Vahan Babushkin, Ainsley Temudo and Kartik K. Sreenivasan and can be found here: link soon.

All codes are in python 2.
